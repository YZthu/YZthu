Hi, welcome to my website. I am a PhD student at University of California, Merced, adviced by Dr. Shijia Pan. I obtained my M.S. and B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2019 and 2016, respectively. My research interest including multimodal human sensing, deep learning, and smart healthcare. 

In life, I am a big fan of hiking and camping, if you plan to visit Yosemite national park, fell free to contact me. I am also play basketabll and skateboarding.
